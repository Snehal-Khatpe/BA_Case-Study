# Case Study

We are looking to build a new messaging application to integrate into the WIN (Wealth Intelligence) Platform 
to allow Wealth Management Firms to communicate directly with their clients. The WIN Platform utilizes Bootstrap with Angular.

Currently, the platform does not allow Wealth Management Firms and clients (end investors) to communicate directly within the system, 
resulting in reliance on external communication channels (e.g., email, phone) 
that lack integration with the platform

The application will allow communication between Clients (end investors) and the Client’s Investment Manager.
Please include as much functionality that a messaging application of this nature might require 
and sufficient functionality to allow the Wealth Management Firm to manage the application. 
Based on the brief above and resources below, we would like you to prepare a high-level product backlog to deliver your proposed solution. P
lease prepare a presentation beforehand to demonstrate the output of the task. 
This could be accompanied with any supporting documentation as you see fit. 

-- Documentation needed (but not limited to) by BA are below:

• Wireframes, Mock ups and Other Visual Documentation
• UML Diagrams
• User Stories
• Business Requirement Document
• Functional requirement specification
• Test case
